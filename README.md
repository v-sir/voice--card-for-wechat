a voice card for-wechat!
thank you for your attentionÔºÅ
Now I want to share you some Reviews about the wechat development projects based on PHP!
First you need read the api documents in http://mp.weixin.qq.com/wiki/home/index.html,and download the  example code in http://mp.weixin.qq.com/mpres/htmledition/res/wx_sample.20140819.zip 
of course,you need a server and domain for yourself.if it's ok,you can begin the trip for coding!here some reviews i want to share you.
1.make sure the config is right,after you finish the config you can test it just write the reply text like 'test' ,if your config is right
you  can receive the 'test' in your wechat app!
2.when you design the objects for wechat ,one thing you must be attention ,Remember not to let your code corresponding to more than 5 seconds,
because if you cann't finish in 5s,the wechat app cann,t receive the information you want the wechat to reply!
3.The php version,it's very important to think more about the version,because there are  some bug in some version to cause the wrong in wechat.
I can tell you some case when I code my projects.the api for upload,you can work well in php 5.4 use the code 
"$ch = curl_init ();  
        $fields = $params;  
        $fields ['file'] = '@' . $file;  
        curl_setopt ( $ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url );  
        curl_setopt ( $ch, CURLOPT_POST, 1 );  
        curl_setopt ( $ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $fields );  
        curl_setopt ( $ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1 );  
        $response = curl_exec ( $ch );  " ,
        but if your version is php 5.6 you will fail to upload with a error message "the media data missing!",so when you write your project
        whit a right code but can't work ,think over the version ,maybe it's the reason.
        
        
  4.about token save 
  it also very important to think of the way to save the token ,the api shows the token will Expired 7200s(2h).you must think if you have
  more users so you can't waste the token frequency.
  
  
  
  Now I want to say something about my voice card project
